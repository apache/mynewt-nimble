        description: >
            This count is used in creating a pool of elements used by the
            code to enqueue various elements. In the case of the controller
            only HCI, this number should be equal to the number of mbufs in
            the msys pool. For host only, it is really dependent on the
            number of ACL buffers that the controller tells the host it
            has.
