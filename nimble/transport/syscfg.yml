            Select HCI transport used towards host.
            "native" means NimBLE host is running on the same core and no

            Select HCI transport used towards controller.
            "native" means NimBLE controller is running on the same core and no
            transport is required.
        value: native

    BLE_TRANSPORT_ACL_COUNT:
        description: >
            Number of ACL buffers available in transport. This determines
            number of buffers used by host/controller for flow control.
            Buffers pool is allocated for each non-native transport side
            selected, unless overriden by BLE_TRANSPORT_ACL_FROM_[HS|LL]_COUNT.
        value: 10
    BLE_TRANSPORT_ACL_SIZE:
        description: Size of each buffer in ACL pool.
        value: 251
    BLE_TRANSPORT_EVT_COUNT:
        description: >
            Number of event buffers available in transport.
        value: 4
    BLE_TRANSPORT_EVT_DISCARDABLE_COUNT:
        description: >
            Number of discardable event buffers available in transport.
            Discardable event buffers are used for events that can be safely
            dropped by controller if there's no free buffer available, e.g.
            advertising reports.
        value: 16
    BLE_TRANSPORT_EVT_SIZE:
        description: >
            Size of each buffer in events pool. This applies to both regular
            and discardable buffers. Value is automatically adjusted if
            extended advertising is enabled so in most cases it's better to
            leave it at default settings.
        value: 70

    BLE_TRANSPORT_ACL_FROM_HS_COUNT:
        description: >
            Overrides BLE_TRANSPORT_ACL_COUNT on host side, i.e. number
            of ACL buffers available for host.
        value: MYNEWT_VAL(BLE_TRANSPORT_ACL_COUNT)
    BLE_TRANSPORT_ACL_FROM_LL_COUNT:
        description: >
            Overrides BLE_TRANSPORT_ACL_COUNT on controller side, i.e. number
            of ACL buffers available for controller.
