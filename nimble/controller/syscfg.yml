            This is expected PDU len for AUX_ADV_IND and subsequent
            AUX_CHAIN_IND. When scheduling scan scheduler will reserve time for
            receiving this amount of time. Setting this to high value improves
            reception of large PDUs but results in wasting scheduler space when
            receiving small PDUs only. On the other hand too low value can
            result in not being able to scan whole PDU due to being preempted
            by next scheduled item. By default size matching legacy ADV_IND PDU
            payload is used: ExtHeader (Flags, AdvA, ADI) + 31 bytes of data.
