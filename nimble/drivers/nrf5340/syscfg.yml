    BLE_PHY_SYSVIEW:
        description: >
            Enable SystemView tracing module for radio driver.
        value: 0

    BLE_PHY_DBG_TIME_TXRXEN_READY_PIN:
        description: >
            When set to proper GPIO pin number, this pin will be set
            to high state when radio is enabled (TASKS_TXEN or TASKS_RXEN)
            and back to low state on radio EVENTS_READY.
            This can be used to measure radio ram-up time.

            Note:
            GPIO control for selected pin needs to be assigned to Network
            Core, configure IPC_NRF5340_NET_GPIO in ipc_nrf5340 driver on
            Application Core.
        value: -1

    BLE_PHY_DBG_TIME_ADDRESS_END_PIN:
        description: >
            When set to proper GPIO pin number, this pin will be set
            to high state on radio EVENTS_ADDRESS and back to low state
            on radio EVENTS_END.
            This can be used to measure radio pipeline delays.

            Note:
            GPIO control for selected pin needs to be assigned to Network
            Core, configure IPC_NRF5340_NET_GPIO in ipc_nrf5340 driver on
            Application Core.

    BLE_PHY_DBG_TIME_WFR_PIN:
        description: >
            When set to proper GPIO pin number, this pin will be set
            to high state on radio EVENTS_RXREADY and back to low
            state when wfr timer expires.
            This can be used to check if wfr is calculated properly.

            Note:
            GPIO control for selected pin needs to be assigned to Network
            Core, configure IPC_NRF5340_NET_GPIO in ipc_nrf5340 driver on
            Application Core.
