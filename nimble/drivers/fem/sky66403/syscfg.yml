        description: >
            GPIO pin number to control CSD signal.
            When set to '-1', pin state will not be changed and it should be
            driven externally.
        value: -1
    SKY66403_PIN_CPS:
        description: >
            GPIO pin number to control CPS signal.
            When set to '-1', pin state will not be changed and it should be
            driven externally.
        value: -1

        description: >
            GPIO pin number to control SEL signal.

        description: >
            Enables linear mode for TX.
            Only valid if CHL signal is controller by driver.
        value: 0
    SKY66403_TX_BYPASS:
        description: >
            Enables bypass for TX which effectively disables operation as PA.
