    BLE_PHY_SYSVIEW:
        description: >
            Enable SystemView tracing module for radio driver.
        value: 0

    BLE_PHY_DBG_TIME_TXRXEN_READY_PIN:
        description: >
            When set to proper GPIO pin number, this pin will be set
            to high state when radio is enabled using PPI channels
            20 or 21 and back to low state on radio EVENTS_READY.
            This can be used to measure radio ram-up time.
        value: -1

    BLE_PHY_DBG_TIME_ADDRESS_END_PIN:
        description: >
            When set to proper GPIO pin number, this pin will be set
            to high state on radio EVENTS_ADDRESS and back to low state
            on radio EVENTS_END.
            This can be used to measure radio pipeline delays.
        value: -1

    BLE_PHY_DBG_TIME_WFR_PIN:
        description: >
            When set to proper GPIO pin number, this pin will be set
            to high state on radio EVENTS_RXREADY and back to low
            state when wfr timer expires.
            This can be used to check if wfr is calculated properly.
        value: -1

            "[164] RADIO: Low selectivity in long range mode"
            This shall be only enabled for:

            "[191] RADIO: High packet error rate in BLE Long Range mode"
            This shall be only enabled for:
            - nRF52840 Engineering B

        description: >
            Ublox BMD-345 modules come with public address preprogrammed
            in UICR register. If enabled public address will be read from
            custom UICR instead of FICR register.
